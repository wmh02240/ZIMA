\<Zima Blue> is a popular science fiction short story, telling about a famous AI artist downgrades itself and sheds off its appendages just to be a more pure, more basic self back to -- as he was originally designed -- a swimming pool cleaning robot.
This project aims to create an universal framework for designing an auto cleaning robot as simple as possable, while it is also easy to maintain and expend its function.

This repo(zima_core) is the core code for project Zima.

It contains:

1. Algorithms (SLAM/Matching/Line segmentation/Pose interpolation).
1. Path planners.
1. Cleaning function logic.
1. Event management.
1. Map relative utils.
1. Nav data management.
